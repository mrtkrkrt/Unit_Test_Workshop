## Software Developer Days 2023 - "Hands-On Spring Boot Unit Testing" Workshop
Hello! This repository is created for the "Hands-On Spring Boot Unit Testing" workshop held at the Software Developer Days 2023 event in Istanbul. This workshop attracted approximately 2000 participants and provided many attendees with the opportunity to gain experience in writing unit tests on Spring Boot.

### About the Workshop
This workshop focused on writing unit tests using the Spring Boot framework. We delved into how various unit tests could be written and explored best practices through live coding sessions. We covered in-depth discussions on the following topics:

* Basics of Spring Boot
* Importance and benefits of unit tests
* Popular unit testing libraries like JUnit and Mockito
* Writing unit tests for Controller, Service, and Repository classes
* Mock database testing in Spring Boot applications
